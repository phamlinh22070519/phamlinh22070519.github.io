        In this tutorial, we are creating a photo shoot effect with our
        just-released PhotoShoot jQuery plug-in. With it you can convert a
        regular div on the page into a photo shooting stage simulating a
        camera-like feel.

        Potential clients want to see who they’ll be working with. They want to
        hire people, not stock photography. We produced a custom photo shoot to
        bring the people of Paterson Buchanan front and center and to underscore
        the firm’s open and welcoming style. Vivid images illustrate Paterson
        Buchanan’s wide range of clients, as well as their commitment to the
        picturesque region the firm serves.
